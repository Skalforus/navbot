Project members - please feel free to fill this in :-) Information can be found [http://beautifullycraftedsoftware.blogspot.com on the original blog] for now.

= Working on NavBot =

The more, the merrier! NavBot is written in C# using Visual Studio Express 2005 - freely available [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-gb/express/aa975050.aspx from M$] - be sure to download the 2005 edition, not 2008 beta 2. The project types aren't backwardly-compatible, so we'll port on the full release of 2008 beta 2. 

NavBot is also fully unit-tested, and is intended to stay that way! You need NUnit to run the tests - available [http://www.nunit.org/index.php?p=download here].

[http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads Tortoise SVN] is recommended for working with the repository.
